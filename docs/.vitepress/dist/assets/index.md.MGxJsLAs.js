It passively listens to LAN activity using packet capture and Linux netlink APIs to infer device presence, identity, and state changes.</p><p>Instead of relying on router integrations or cloud services, foxd observes the network directly. It correlates ARP traffic, DHCP activity, and kernel neighbor updates to build a real-time view of all devices on the network.</p><p>The daemon runs continuously in the background and exposes both a REST API and a built-in web console. Device state, rules, and configuration are stored locally, allowing foxd to restart cleanly and operate offline.</p><p>foxd is designed for environments where reliability, low overhead, and local control matter more than dashboards and vendor lock-in.</p><h2 id="about-p8labs" tabindex="-1">About P8labs <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-p8labs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About P8labs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>P8labs is an independent engineering lab focused on building small, composable infrastructure tools.</p><p>The goal is not large platforms or cloud services, but durable software that runs close to the system, respects user control, and remains understandable over time. Projects from P8labs emphasize local-first operation, minimal dependencies, and clear internal architecture.</p><p>foxd reflects that philosophy: a focused daemon that does one job well, integrates cleanly with other systems, and stays out of the way once deployed.</p>',9)])])}const m=t(o,[["render",s]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
